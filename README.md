## My Projects

This is a list of things that I have already implemented. When a project
graduates from being just an idea or experiment, I will add it here. Feel
free to check out anything you may be interested in. :)

Bevy Crates:
 - [`iyes_loopless`](https://github.com/IyesGames/iyes_loopless):
   Improved replacements for Bevy RunCriteria/States/FixedTimestep/SystemSet
 - [`bevy_asset_ron`](https://github.com/IyesGames/bevy_asset_ron):
   Generic RON file format assets
 - [`bevy_loading`](https://github.com/IyesGames/bevy_loading):
   Progress tracking and state transition helper

Meta:
 - [`iyesengine`](https://github.com/IyesGames/iyesengine):
   My (personal, opinionated) meta-distribution of Bevy + Plugins

## Personal Dev Notebook

The `notebook` directory is a `mdbook` that serves as my dev journal.

I document various things related to Bevy and gamedev going on in my head,
there. :)

It serves 2 purposes:

 - Help me keep track of all my ideas and designs. I have far too many to
   implement them all, or to even keep them all in my head. I'd rather write
   my thoughts down, knowing I may or may not implement them some day.
 - Let anyone who is interested know what I'm doing.
