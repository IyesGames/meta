# Meta Organization Repository

# [![IyesGames](https://github.com/IyesGames/branding/raw/main/logo/iyesgames.png)](https://iyes.games)

This is primarily a documentation repository. I document all the Bevy-related
things going on in my head, here. :)

It serves 2 purposes:

 - Help me keep track of all my ideas and designs. I have far too many to
   implement them all, or to even keep them all in my head. I'd rather write
   my thoughts down, knowing I may or may not implement them some day.
 - Let anyone who is interested know what I'm doing.

The `notebook` directory is a `mdbook` that serves as my dev journal.

## "Completed" Projects

This is a list of things that I have already implemented. When a project
graduates from being just an idea or experiment, I will add it here. Feel
free to check out anything you may be interested in. :)
